----------------

JSON feed. Pull with plantid. 
In the first version every plant is public.

--------

A json request is directed to a go routine where every live plant is controlled.
If the plant is not live, the controller will launch it as a new go routine. 
The channel to this new go routine is recorded in a map with the plantid as key. 
When the plant is live, the controller will have the channel in the map.
The json request is then replied via the given channel from http server.
